Now I am a postdoc at MPIM Bonn, after I obtained my doctorate degree at Tsinghua University in the fall of 2024, under the supervision of Fan Xu. I work in the field of algebraic representation theory.

My reserach interests are cluster algebras and Hall algebras. In particular, I am very interested in the categorification of quantum cluster algebras and Cohomological Hall algebras.
